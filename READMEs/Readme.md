This is my first project so there might be some small problems... excuse me for that,
Anyways,
This is as you can see a Encoder - Decoder.
I got inspiration of this from how armies would send encrypted messages during wars. it essentially does the same thing except for smaller words(yet) and much more complex encryption

So in Encoder.java, run it and 

        1. **put in 6 paramaters first** (they can be any 32 bit integers) 
        2. **enter 6 charactered word**
        you will then get output of those 6 parameters and a garbled word. that garbled word is your encrypted word.

        now you can send those 6 parameters and encrypted word to anywhere you want to send for decryption.

now you want to decode the word that garbled word then in
       decoder.java         

         1. **enter those same parameter**
         2. **put in that garbled word** (it may not be possible to type those as they consist of all characters within UTF-8 encoding(over 32000) and you might not have required font for it. so you can just copy paste them)

         ***viola you get your word back*** 
         congrats on winning war















ps - this might be most unprofesional readme ever lol
