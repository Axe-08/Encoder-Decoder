this project may not serve any practical purpose but i'm proud of it because it crystallisation of all i've learned till now about java program.
it is not to say that this is perfect endcoder and decoder,
as anyone with little knowledge about CS can read the code (as it is not secure enough) and figure out whats going on.
so here are few cons for future versions to solve:-
  1. lack of modularisation. 
  2. only 6 letters.
  3. rule method is not secure which is a security feature to be considered.
  4. use of parameters is too old school i would like to replace it something else like a key.


  thats all i can think of now...good luck future me (◕‿↼)!!
